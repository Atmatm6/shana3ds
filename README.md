# shana3ds

A test project for me to use that can be build in the most normal way possible,
using the template from devkitPro.

## TODO

0. ~~Complete the basics (create 3dsx for homebrew launcher)~~ **Completed**
    - ~~Create a CIA file~~

1. ~~Use the native keyboard (swkbd)~~ **Completed**
    - ~~Get keyboard data and display on screen~~

2. Create a calculator
    - Use the keyboard's numpad to do simple math.
    - Allow using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
